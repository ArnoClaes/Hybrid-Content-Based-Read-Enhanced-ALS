## The main algorithm
The way from raw data to the final recommendations need multiple data-cleaning, preprocessing, calculation and post-processing steps.
The raw input data consists out of 3 types: 
1) URL list
2) Click-data
3) Event-data

Mind that all the data given below is completely fictional, as the real data is protected for privacy reasons.
The URL list has the following lay-out:

| URL | TAG |
| :-------------: | :-------------: |
| url_1  | tag_1  |
| url_2  | tag_1  |

The first step is to manually scrape the raw text from all the URLS and scrape the TITLE, READING_TIME and DATE (publish) from the pages using a HTML webscraper. All these steps were combined, manually in an excel file. After the merging, the data will look as follows:

| URL | TITLE | READING_TIME | DATE | TAG | TEXT |
| :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: |
| url_1 | title_1 | x minuten | date_1 | tag_1 | "Etiam faucibus iaculis lorem sit..." |
| url_2 | title_1 | y minuten | date_2 | tag_2 | " Duis sagittis lobortis volutpat... " |
